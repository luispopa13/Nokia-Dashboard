This project consists of a React frontend and a PHP backend. Follow these steps to run it locally:

Frontend (React):

Open the main project folder in Visual Studio Code.

Inside the project, go to the frontend folder, and then into the tickets-dashboard folder.

Open a terminal and run the command: cd frontend/tickets-dashboard

Once inside the tickets-dashboard folder, install all dependencies by running: npm install

After the installation is complete, start the React development server by running: npm start

The app will be available in your browser at http://localhost:3000.

Backend (PHP with XAMPP):

Make sure you have XAMPP installed on your computer.

Locate the tickets-api folder from this project â€” it contains all your PHP scripts and API endpoints.

Copy the tickets-api folder and paste it into the htdocs directory inside your XAMPP installation (usually at C:\xampp\htdocs).

After that, the full path should look like: C:\xampp\htdocs\tickets-api

Open the XAMPP Control Panel and start the Apache server.

Your backend APIs will now be accessible at: http://localhost/tickets-api.
